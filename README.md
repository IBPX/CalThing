## Setup

CalThing functions as a LibreOffice/OpenOffice template.  
You simply need to open it with your respective program, and it will create a new document for you to work with.

## Using

To start, rename the people on the left to the names of your guests. You can delete extra rows if neccesary.  
Then, to set a person's status for a day, go to that cell in that person's row, and change it to one of the following:

    0:    Can't go.
    0.5:  Maybe.
    1:    Can go.
